# lua-exploit-functions

Register custom functions in your `lua` environment without the use of `Lua C` functions. Purely written in `luau`.

# purpose?

A lot of people do not have access to the `Lua C` **API** which can be tough to recreate especially with the `__inline` update that struck about 1.5 years ago.

This repo simply makes some of the functions alive again. It creates them in any execution type, so no need to worry about your execution being `axon, calamari, arch` or just methods in general.

# how to use?

Each function has its own name (*for example: info*) you just read the script and it works! Call the `function` using its proper name and parameters.

# NOTE

THIS SHOULD NEVER BE USED BY SOMEONE ADVANCED. ONLY USE THIS IF YOU ARE A PURE NOOB OR YOU JUST LEARNT HOW TO UPDATE A DLL SOURCE AND YOU WANT FUNCTIONS. GO FLEX THIS GARBAGE OUT TO YOUR FRIENDS. YOU SHOULD PASS THE FAKE FUNCTION TEST BY 1%.
